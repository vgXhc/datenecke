      <description>My home town, Madison (Wis.), has automated bike counters on two of the city’s busiest bike paths, the Southwest Path and the Capital City Trail. The data is available with hourly counts on Madison’s Open Data portal, spanning several years. In this post series I will combine the bike count data with climate data to investigate the relationship between bike counts, temperature, and precipitation. How many more (or fewer) people bike on a day that is 5 degrees colder, or when it snows?</description>

      <description>I got some good feedback after posting my article on Madison’s zoning restrictions on Facebook and Reddit, prompting some additional analyses.
Why do you look only at residentially zoned land?Several people pointed out that comparing the zoning districts that only allow detached single-family homes (SFR) to all residential zoning districts may be misleading. In many cities the densest parts are not in residential zoning districts but in downtown areas zoned for mixed use.</description>
