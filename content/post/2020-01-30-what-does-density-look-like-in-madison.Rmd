This is a follow-up to my previous post on *where* Madison is most dense. But what do these dense areas look like? Inspired by the ["Every Lot" bot]( http://fakeisthenewreal.org/everylot/), I'll use the [static Google Street View API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro) via the `googleway` package to (hopefully) create some visual sense of density. 
```{r results='hide', collapse = TRUE}
## Code from previous post to get 10 most dense block groups in Dane County
library(sf)
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(leaflet)
library(googleway)
key <- Sys.getenv("STREET_VIEW_API_KEY") #key requires a credit card on file

pop <- get_acs(geography = "block group", 
                     variables = "B01003_001", 
                     state = "WI",
                     county = "Dane",
                     geometry = TRUE,
                     keep_geo_vars = TRUE)
pop2 <- pop %>% 
  mutate(pop_density = estimate / (ALAND /27878400)) %>%  #create variable for population density
  drop_na %>%
  filter(pop_density > 100000) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pop_density)) %>% 
  head(10)
```

A good starting point for exploration would be the [centroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid#Of_a_polygon) of the block group. Block groups can have odd shapes, though, which can lead to the true centroid ending up outside the polygon. I'll use `st_point_on_surface` instead.

```{r}
pop2 <- pop2 %>% 
  mutate(center = st_point_on_surface(geometry))
```

A quick visual check:
```{r}
library(ggmap)
ggplot(data = pop2) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = pop_density), 
          alpha = 0.5,
          color = NA) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = center))
```

Looks good! Turns out that ten densest block groups form one contiguous area. Now let's get Street View images. Testing with the first row:

```{r}
google_streetview(location = st_coordinates(pop2$center[1]),
    size = c(400,400), output = "plot",
    key = key)
```

"No imagery here" -- that's because lat/lon are in the reverse order! I'll fix this, and in order to save API calls I'll also turn on the `response_check` option in `google_streetview`


```{r}
google_streetview(location =  c(st_coordinates(pop2$center[1])[2],
                                st_coordinates(pop2$center[1])[1]),
    size = c(400,400), 
    output = "plot",
    response_check = TRUE,
    key = key)
```

Still no luck. What apparently is going on is that there is no Street View imagery at the *exact* coordinates -- which isn't too surprising that the coordinates are just some point inside a block group and not necessarily on or near a street. The Every Lot project doesn't have this issue, as per definition a lot has a street address. A couple ideas to resolve the problem:

* rounding the coordinates to a less precise location may make this more forgiving
* reverse-geocode the coordinates with something like the Census Geocoder to obtain street addresses

The first option is easier to implement and I'll try it out first. This [XKCD comic](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2170:_Coordinate_Precision) helps figure out how much rounding is needed:

![XKCD comic on coordinate precision](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/8/88/coordinate_precision.png)

"A specific suburban cul-de-sac"-level accuracy with 3 digits sounds good.

```{r}
google_streetview(location =  round(c(st_coordinates(pop2$center[1])[2],
                                st_coordinates(pop2$center[1])[1]), 3),
    size = c(1000,400), 
    fov = 120,
    output = "plot",
    response_check = TRUE,
    key = key)
```

Great, it works! I also adjusted the `fov` (field of view) to 120 degrees in order to get as much context as possible in the image.

Time to pack this into a function and get images for the top-10 densest block groups.

```{r}

get_sv <- function(x) {
  print(paste0("Block Group ", pop2$BLKGRPCE[x], " in Census Tract ", pop2$TRACTCE[x], " has a population density of ", round(pop2$pop_density[x], 0), " people per square mile and it looks like so:"))
  google_streetview(location =  round(c(st_coordinates(pop2$center[x])[2],
                                st_coordinates(pop2$center[x])[1]), 3),
    size = c(1000,400), 
    fov = 120,
    output = "plot",
    response_check = TRUE,
    key = key)
}
```

## 10th-densest block group: Block Group 2, Census Tract 16.06

```{r echo = FALSE}
get_sv(10)
```

## 9th-densest: Block Group 1, Census Tract 16.05

```{r echo = FALSE}
get_sv(9)
```


## 8th-densest: Block Group 2, Census Tract 16.04
```{r echo = FALSE}
get_sv(8)
```

## 7-th densest: Block Group 1, Census Tract 16.04
```{r echo = FALSE}
get_sv(7)
```

## 6th-densest: Block Group 1, Census Tract 16.03
```{r echo = FALSE}
get_sv(6)
```

## 5th-densest: Block Group 3, Census Tract 16.04
```{r echo = FALSE}
get_sv(5)
```

## 4th-densest: Block Group 1, Census Tract 16.06
```{r echo = FALSE}
get_sv(4)
```

## 3rd-densest: Block Group 2, Census Tract 16.03
```{r echo = FALSE}
get_sv(3)
```

## 2nd-densest: Block Group 4, Census Tract 16.04
```{r echo = FALSE}
get_sv(2)
```

## The densest of them all: Block Group 4, Census Tract 16.06
```{r echo = FALSE}
get_sv(1)
```

## Conclusion
Static Street View images of a single location in a block group don't tell the whole story of density. But they do provide a nice snapshot of the built form in the dense parts of Madison: Pretty much all of the buildings you can see cater primarily to UW-Madison students, but they take on different forms. You have freestanding historic multiplexes with probably 3-10 units (BG 1, tract 16.05) that may once have been large single-family homes; generic 3-5 story apartment buildings from the second half of the 20th century; and then mid- and high-rise buildings, either built as residence halls by the university (e.g. [Witte Hall](https://www.housing.wisc.edu/residence-halls/witte/) with over 1200 units in the densest block group) or as private development (e.g. [Lucky Apartments](https://lucky.stevebrownapts.com/) in the third-densest block group). Block group 1 in tract 16.06 does a great job of showing all of these building types in one shot.
