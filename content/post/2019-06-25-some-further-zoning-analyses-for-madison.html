<p>I got some good feedback after posting my article on Madison’s zoning restriction on Facebook and Reddit, prompting some additional analyses.</p>
<div id="why-do-you-look-only-at-residentially-zoned-land" class="section level1">
<h1>Why do you look only at residentially zoned land?</h1>
<p>Several people pointed out that comparing the zoning districts that only allow detached single-family homes (SFR) to all <em>residential</em> zoning districts may be misleading. In many cities the densest parts are not in residential zoning districts but in downtown areas zoned for mixed use. I think that’s a fair point, but it was the original NYT article that chose only residential areas as the comparator, and I wanted to make Madison comparable to the other cities in the NYT analysis.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I quickly ran the analysis comparing SFR to any district except “special districts.” These includes parks, conservancies, agricultural land, airports, or the UW-Campus—in other words districts that are highly unlikely to ever have residential use.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>other &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;,
           &quot;UA&quot;,
           &quot;CN&quot;,
           &quot;PR&quot;,
           &quot;AP&quot;,
           &quot;CI&quot;,
           &quot;PD&quot;,
           &quot;PHMP&quot;)

#detached single-family only
res_sfr &lt;- data %&gt;%
  filter(ZONING_CODE %in% sfr_zones) %&gt;%
  summarize(sum(ShapeSTArea))

# only special district area
other_area &lt;- data %&gt;%
  filter(ZONING_CODE %in% other) %&gt;%
  summarise(sum(ShapeSTArea))

total &lt;- data %&gt;% summarize(sum(ShapeSTArea))
res_sfr/(total-other_area)</code></pre>
<p>The result? 49% of all land that reasonably could have residential units on it allows only single-family attached housing. Since there is no point of comparison to other cities, it’s hard to interpret that number.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-there-a-correlation-between-the-percentage-of-sfr-zoning-and-overall-density" class="section level1">
<h1>Is there a correlation between the percentage of SFR zoning and overall density?</h1>
<p>It’s a good question: Does the metric the NYT used actually have an association with overall density of a city? (Note that even if there is a correlation, this absolutely doesn’t mean there is a causal connection! There are many, many factors that impact a city’s overall density.)</p>
<p>There are few data points to work with. I retrieved density information for all the NYT cities and Madison from Wikipedia:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dens_zon &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/density_zoning.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s see what the overall correlation is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code> dens_zon %&gt;% 
   spread(Measure, Value) %&gt;%
   summarize(cor(density, sfr))</code></pre>
<p>Hm, -0.885. That’s a very, very strong correlation. But it’s always good to look at your data points in a scatterplot:</p>
<pre class="r"><code> dens_zon %&gt;% 
   spread(Measure, Value) %&gt;%
   ggplot(aes(sfr, density, label = City)) +
   geom_point() +
   geom_text(check_overlap = TRUE, angle = 45, vjust = 0.1, hjust = -0.1, size = 3) +
   scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 35000)) +
   scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0.2)) +
   xlab(&quot;Proportion detached single family zoning to all residential zoning&quot;) +
   ylab(&quot;Overall density (population/sq mi)&quot;)</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="lets-take-out-nyc">let’s take out NYC</h1>
<p>dens_zon %&gt;% + spread(Measure, Value) %&gt;% + filter(City != “New York”) %&gt;% + summarize(cor(density, sfr)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 <code>cor(density, sfr)</code> <dbl> 1 -0.693</p>
<h1 id="lets-also-take-out-dc">let’s also take out DC</h1>
<p>dens_zon %&gt;% + spread(Measure, Value) %&gt;% + filter(City != “New York” &amp; City != “Washington”) %&gt;% + summarize(cor(density, sfr)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 <code>cor(density, sfr)</code> <dbl> 1 -0.366</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then created a scatterplot.</p>
