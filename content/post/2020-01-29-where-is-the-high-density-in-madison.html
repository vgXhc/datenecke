<p>A recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/arts/density-housing-skyscraper-museum.html"><em>New York Times</em> article</a> reviews a new exhibit at the Skyscraper Museum and claims that “Everything You Think You Know About Housing Is Probably Wrong.” Much of it centers around population or housing density, or the perception thereof.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However you calculate it, the word “density” sounds a lot like a synonym for overcrowding and congestion, for too-tall buildings and greedy real estate developers, unwanted neighbors and lost parking spaces. Such associations make the mere mention of the term a Molotov cocktail that opponents of housing initiatives can lob at community board meetings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exhibit then shows how these perception are often ahistorical or plain wrong: Low-income tenements in the first half of the centuries were replaced with “tower-in-the-park” public housing – which is a net lowering of density. And the densest neighborhood in many US cities are also among their wealthiest.</p>
<p>I was curious what density would look like in Madison. Because I couldn’t easily find a map that shows this data, I used this as an excuse to work on my mapping skills in R.</p>
<div id="getting-population-data-and-prepare-for-mapping" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting population data and prepare for mapping</h1>
<p>Population data at the level of the block group is available from the American Community Survey API. The <code>tidycensus</code> package provides a great interface to get the data into R. The <code>sf</code> package provides a variety of geographic functions. And <code>leaflet</code> is a mapping framework, which I’m using for the first time in R.</p>

<p>If you don’t already know the name of the population variable, you can get a list of all variables with <code>load_variables</code> and then filter through them in the RStudio table viewer interface.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>v18 &lt;- load_variables(2018, &quot;acs5&quot;, cache = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>The total population variable is B01003_001. Now download the data for Dane County with <code>get_acs</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>pop &lt;- get_acs(geography = &quot;block group&quot;, 
                     variables = &quot;B01003_001&quot;, 
                     state = &quot;WI&quot;,
                     county = &quot;Dane&quot;,
                     geometry = TRUE,
                     keep_geo_vars = TRUE) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## Getting data from the 2013-2017 5-year ACS</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Downloading feature geometry from the Census website.  To cache shapefiles for use in future sessions, set `options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)`.</code></pre>
<p>The <code>geometry = TRUE</code> parameter means that the dataframe will contain the polygons for each block group; <code>keep_geo_vars = TRUE</code> is useful because it means a land area variable, <code>ALAND</code> will be included. One could calculate the area from the polygons, but why expend extra effort when the Census has already done the work for you.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pop2 &lt;- pop %&gt;% 
  mutate(pop_density = estimate / (ALAND /27878400)) %&gt;%  #create variable for population density
  drop_na</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ALAND</code> variable is in square feet, and I converted it to the more common people per square mile metric. A quick histogram shows that the data has a strong right skew, with most block groups having very low density.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>qplot(pop_density, data = pop2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.</code></pre>

<p>This will make a choropleth map hard to read and so I’ll focus on the block groups with more than 100,000 people/mi².</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pop2 &lt;- pop2 %&gt;%
  filter(pop_density &gt; 100000)</code></pre>

<div id="choroplet-map-with-leaflet" class="section level1">
<h1>Choroplet map with Leaflet</h1>
<p>Initially I tried producing maps with <code>ggmap</code>, which is a great package but better suited for static, print maps. Courtesty of Julia Silge’s <a href="https://juliasilge.com/blog/using-tidycensus/">great tutorial</a>, I was able to use <code>leaflet</code> for my map instead.</p>
<p>First we create a stepped color palette for the map by dividing the population density values into 5 bins:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pal &lt;- colorBin(palette = &quot;viridis&quot;, domain = pop2$pop_density, bins = 5)</code></pre>
<p>Then we can create the actual choropleth map:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pop2 %&gt;%
  st_transform(crs = &quot;+init=epsg:4326&quot;) %&gt;% #don&#39;t fully understand
  leaflet(width = &quot;80%&quot;) %&gt;%
  addProviderTiles(provider = &quot;Stamen.TonerLite&quot;) %&gt;%
  addPolygons(popup = ~ paste0(str_extract(NAME.y, &quot;^([^,]*)&quot;),
                               &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;,
                               round(pop_density, 0),
                               &quot; people/sq mi&quot;),
              stroke = FALSE,
              smoothFactor = 0,
              fillOpacity = 0.7,
              color = ~ pal(pop_density)) %&gt;%
  addLegend(&quot;bottomright&quot;, 
            pal = pal, 
            values = ~ pop_density,
            title = &quot;Population density&quot;,
            opacity = 1)</code></pre>
